## Eight (or ten) quick tips for reproducible collaborative research

1. Establish a shared vision

2. Define the folder struction and file naming conventions

3. Make the data accessible

   - Ideally in the way that it will ultimately be made public
   
4. Include metadata that describes the data, in an accessible form

5. Make the software accessible

6. Synchronize local workspaces automatically

   - If manual steps are required, they won't happen consistently
     or regularly
     
7. Work out who will do what, and with reasonable timelines

8. Maintain regular communication

9. Take advantage of the opportunities for peer review of software and documentation, and to test reproducibility of pipelines/workflows
